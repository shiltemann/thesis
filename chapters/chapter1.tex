Bioinformatics plays a role in a wide range of research fields. While the biology might be vastly different, many of the underlying bioinformatics concepts are shared and may be reused regardless of the scientific application. This chapter covers a number of such generic bioinformatics applications. The Galaxy project provides a graphical user interface to commandline unix tools. iReport provides a generic reporting tool within the Galaxy framework. Circos offers visualisation for high-dementional data. The myFAIR application is designed to integrate the Galaxy platform to FAIR data management applications, to further facilitate reproducible research.

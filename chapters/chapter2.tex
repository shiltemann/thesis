Training is a vital component of accessible research. Galaxy enables the domain experts to perform complex analyses without needing to consult with a bioinformatician. This also makes Galaxy an ideal platform for training, allowing learners to focus solely on the analysis and scientific concepts, not the minutia of tool installation and maintenance or the commandline interface details. To this end, we developed a training infrastructure for the Galaxy platform, designed for ease-of-use for both learners and trainers.

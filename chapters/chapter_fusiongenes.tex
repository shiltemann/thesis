Structural variations are large-scale rearrangements of the genome. When these alterations occurr within genes, novel hybrid genes called \emph{fusion genes} may be formed. Accurate detection of SVs and resulting fusion genes are an informative in cancer research studies. This chapters describes:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item iFUSE: integrated fusion gene explorer
\item Gene fusions by chromothripsis of chromosome 5q in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line
\end{enumerate}

We created iFUSE to explore structural variants and identify possible fusion genes, and subsequently used this tool to detect chromothripsis and multiple fusions in VCaP cell line.

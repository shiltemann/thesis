Structural variations are large-scale rearrangements of the genome. When these alterations occur within genes, novel hybrid genes called \emph{fusion genes} may be formed. Accurate detection of SVs and resulting fusion genes are an informative in cancer research studies.

We created iFUSE, web-based application to visualize and explore structural variants, and identify and prioritize potential fusion genes within a sample. We subsequently used this tool to detect multiple fusions in VCaP cell line. Futhermore, we were discovered chromothirpsis on chromosome 5q of this sample, and used the Circos tool to visualize this in a single plot.

This chapter contains the following sub-chapters:

\item \textbf{iFUSE:} integrated fusion gene explorer
\item Gene fusions by chromothripsis of chromosome 5q in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Note on Availability}
Due to changed policies at the EMC, we are no longer able to offer the iFUSE application as a service as described in the publication. In order to keep iFUSE freely available to all, I have created a Docker image of the application, allowing anybody to run iFUSE on their own computer. Please see the GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/erasmusmc-bioinformatics/ifuse} for further details.

This chapter contains the following sub-chapters:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\ref{chapter:fusiongenes}.\arabic*]
\itemsep-0.5em
\item \textbf{iFUSE:} integrated fusion gene explorer
\item Gene fusions by chromothripsis of chromosome 5q in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line
\end{enumerate}


Structural variations are large-scale rearrangements of the genome. When these alterations occurr within genes, novel hybrid genes called \emph{fusion genes} may be formed. Accurate detection of SVs and resulting fusion genes are an informative in cancer research studies.

We created iFUSE to explore structural variants and identify possible fusion genes, and subsequently used this tool to detect chromothripsis and multiple fusions in VCaP cell line.

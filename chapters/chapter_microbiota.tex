With sequencing costs steadily decreasing, 16S sequencing has become a viable alternative to culture-based methods in routine clinical diagnostics. For any clinical application, extensive validation is required. To pilot the utility of 16S profiling in a clinical setting, we first integrated the full mothur toolsuite into Galaxy (GmT), and subsequently used this toolsuite to create a set of workflows for clinical experimental designs in collaboration with Streeklab Haarlem (MYcrobiota).

This chapter contains the following sub-chapters:

\item \textbf{Galaxy mothur Toolset (GmT):} a user-friendly application for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis using mothur
\item \textbf{MYcrobiota:} Development and evaluation of a culture-free microbiota profiling platform for clinical diagnostics
\end{enumerate}

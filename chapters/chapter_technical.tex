iReport, Circos?, myFAIR?, Galaxy2018update? (I am co-author and technically everybody is
shared first on that? would fit nicely with the overall story as every other paper connects
to Galaxy.)
- Training paper in its own section or add it here?

The vast majority of bioinformatics tools are UNIX-based commandline applications, that are not easy to use for non-bioinformaticians. This chapter describes three resources developed to increase the accessibility of bioinformatics tools and pipelines for non-experts, in the following sub-chapters:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item \textbf{The Galaxy platform} for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2018 update
\item \textbf{iReport}: A generalised Galaxy solution for integrated experimental reporting
\item \textbf{Galactic Circos}: User-friendly creation of Circos Plots within the Galaxy platform
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{Galaxy platform} aims to improve the user-friendliness of bioinformatics tools by providing a web-based graphical user interface to commandline UNIX tools. This enables data scientists to run complex bioinformatics analyses needing nothing more than a web browser.

Analysis pipelines often generate a large number of outputs, and with the explosion of data in next generation sequencing field, many of these resulting outputs contain millions of lines and can no longer easily be reviewed manually.

Circos is a tool that enables visualisation of high-dimensional data in a circular plot. Circos is extremely flexible but has a high degree of complexity and a steep learning curve. We developed \textbf{Galactic Circos}, a Galaxy version of the Circos tool, to increase its usability for non-bioinformaticians, and to improve interoperability with upstream tools.

Visualisation and summarisation of results has become an integral part of any analysis pipeline. The \textbf{iReport} tool provides generic reporting within the Galaxy framework for easy summarization of analysis results. This result can help researchers and clinician quickly interpret their data.

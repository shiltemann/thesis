Training is a vital component of accessible research. Galaxy enables the domain experts to perform complex analyses without needing to consult with a bioinformatician. This user-friendliness also makes Galaxy an ideal platform for training, allowing learners to focus solely on the analysis and scientific concepts, rather than the minutiae of tool installation and maintenance or the commandline interface details. To this end, we developed a central, community-driven infrastructure for Galaxy training materials, designed for ease-of-use for both trainees and instructors. Furthermore, by centralising training materials, maintenance and expansion becomes a collaborative effort supported by the global Galaxy trainer community.

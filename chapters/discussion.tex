Write awesome discussion here!

Discuss current limitations and possible future remedies/directions

\section{The Bio, Futuromics}

\subsection{Single-cell Sequencing}

\subsection{Ultra-long high-quality reads}
making de-novo assembly possible

\subsection{Environment}
do not consider cancer cells in isolation but combine with surrounding tissue/immune system information and consider as a whole


\section{The Informatics}

<bigger better more RAM/CPU to keep up with the ever increasing data sizes>

<make it usable - the biologists have the knowledge for interpretation, software should be usable by them, not just bioinformaticians, Galaxy/docker/conda etc helps with this>

<make it maintainable as developers by adhering to coding best-practices and through the use of continuous integration strategies>

<training is vital, the more complex these methods get, the harder it will be to draw accurate conclusions>

<quantum computing?>

just testing a citation: iReport \cite{ireport}.

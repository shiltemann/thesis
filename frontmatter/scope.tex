\chapter*{Scope of Thesis}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Laying the technical groundwork: development of tools for easy analysis (CGtag) and reporting and exploration of data (iFuse, iReport[@ireport])
    \item Using these tools to analyse VCaP, chromothripsis
    \item Often you discover that standard tools are still lacking for your use case: Many samples had missing normals, standard analysis did not suffice, created Virtual Normal approach
    \item Thinking bigger: after reconstructing genes (iFUSE), try reconstructing entire cancer genome (resolve multi-break fusion genes)
\end{enumerate}

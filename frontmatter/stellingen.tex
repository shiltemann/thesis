\item 1 anything goes, academically defensible or not
\end{itemize}

\item Open science mindset facilitates scientifc progress and reproducibility (this thesis)

\begin{itemize}
\item This manuscript
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Training is pivotal
    \item A good virtual normal set is equally valuable as an associated normal
    \item open science is important
    \item (stephan) "The general adoption of MYcrobiota will greatly improve the standardization of microbiota profiling results between individual experiments, laboratories and scientific publications"
    \end{itemize}
\item Academia
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Scientists should write up results for general public as well as scientific journals
     \item Open science FTW, no more paywalled journals or use money to pay peer reviewers to do thorough testing or professional reviewers.
     \item Do we even need journals? system of completely open peer review could replace
     \item post-publication public peer review FTW

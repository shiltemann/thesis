\chapter*{Stellingen}

Eleven propositions must be added to the doctoral dissertation. Of these propositions,
five must relate to the contents of the doctoral dissertation and five must not relate,
either directly or indirectly, to the contents of the doctoral dissertation. These ten
propositions must be academically defensible. The eleventh proposition does not have
to meet the criterion of academic defensibility. The doctoral candidate must submit the
propositions to the doctoral dissertation supervisor as soon as possible following the
approval of the doctoral dissertation as referred to in Article 5.1.

\begin{itemize}
\item 5 from thesis, academically defensible
\item 5 unrelated to thesis, academically defensible
\item anything, academically defensible or not
\end{itemize}


ideas

\begin{itemize}
\item Academia
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Scientists should write up results for general public as well as scientific journals
     \item Open science FTW, no more paywalled journals. or use money to pay peer reviewers to do thorough testing. or professional reviewers.
     \item Do we even need journals? system of completely open peer review could replace
     \item peer review should be done without revealing authors names, not even to editors, no cover letters from hot shot PIs to get into high impact journals, only the merits of the work should count.
